Note: Many projects in this repository import other projects. If you see

    import sys
    sys.path.append('C:\\git\\else\\ratelimiter'); import ratelimiter

Just come back to this page and download those files. You can put them in your Lib folder, or in the same folder as the program you're trying to use, or you can modify the sys path extension.
