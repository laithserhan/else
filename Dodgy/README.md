Ideas for later:

Smokescreen pickup: Exclamators cannot detect player. Will wander randomly for 5-10 steps

Gold candy: Special candy which gives quadruple points. Is invisible, flashes every 5 steps, relocates if not found fast enough

Decoy: Create a phantom player which will move opposite of the player's controls. Exclamators will follow it instead of the player. Fades after 10 steps

Enemies spawn in larger numbers as the game goes on

Enemies move faster as the game goes on

Randomzied walls in the middle of the arena

Arena walls may be boobytrapped. Running alongside a wall may result in death/stun to disincentivize this tactic

Save game scores in db

Exclamators should not be able to fall into the same tile
