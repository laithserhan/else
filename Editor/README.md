Editor
==========

A neat idea that I would one day like to make into a website or something. Users read and write text files simply by choosing the file name. If it exists, the text is returned to them for editing. If it does not, it will be created when they press Save. No logins and no file security. Since it's using a database instead of actual txt files, there are no filename character restrictions, only a maximum title length for sanity's sake.

For now, it's just a tkinter toy.
