Dungeon Generator
=================

Generates dungeons that could be used in a video game or something. Isn't that great?

The results tend to look a little bit dumb, but it seems to work. 

Things that I'm not yet 100% confident about:

1. That all rooms will always be in a contiguous network. Looking good so far.
2. That no tunnels will dig into the wall of a room (with no padding between wall and tunnel). Seems good so far.
3. Whether or not I will come up with a good solution to the tunnels getting close to each other and forming a double-wide. No immediate plans for this one.
